# 3D_Flocking
The following is a demo of 3D flocking built in an OpenGL framework that I created.
To view and play around with the demo you can simply run the executable title 'framework' in the Flocking folder, there is an antweak bar that will allow you to add boids, view debug (direction vectors, which I recommend), and add obstacles to avoid.
Also in this folder you will find the source code for the flocking algorithm I implemented, Boid.cpp and GameLogic.cpp.
The research paper I wrote on this algorithm is included as well, in case you are interested in the approach I used, or flocking in general.
